# ♟️🌀 3D Chess Board in Python

## 📖 Overview
This project implements a **3D Chess Board** in Python, allowing players to experience chess in a more interactive and visually engaging way. Unlike traditional 2D chess, this project adds a third dimension to the board, pieces, and movements, enhancing the complexity and realism of gameplay.  

The program provides a **graphical user interface (GUI)**, manages the rules of chess, and supports interaction between two players. It’s built to demonstrate advanced Python programming concepts, data structures, and visualization techniques.

## 🛠️ Features
- 🧩 **3D Chess Board Rendering** – Pieces and board represented in three dimensions.  
- ♟️ **Standard Chess Rules** – Enforces legal moves, checks, checkmates, and stalemates.  
- 👥 **Two-player Mode** – Players can alternate turns in the same environment.  
- 🖥️ **GUI Support** – Smooth graphical rendering of the chessboard and moves.  
- 🎮 **Move Validation** – Ensures only legal moves are allowed.  
- 📜 **Game History** – Logs moves for replay or analysis.  
- ⚡ **Optimized Codebase** – Efficient handling of a large codebase (~3000 lines).

## 🚀 Getting Started
### ✅ Prerequisites
- Python 3.x  
- Required libraries (e.g., `pygame`, `tkinter`, `matplotlib`, or any 3D rendering library you used).  

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

### ▶️ Running the Program

```bash
python chess3d.py
```

---

## 💻 Example Run

```
Launching 3D Chess Board...
Player 1 (White) vs Player 2 (Black)
Board initialized with 64 pieces
White's Move: e2 → e4
Black's Move: e7 → e5
...
```

## 📊 Explanation

* The game begins with a **standard chess setup** on a **3D-rendered board**.
* Players alternate turns, selecting pieces and moving them within the rules of chess.
* Illegal moves are blocked, and the game continues until **checkmate, stalemate, or draw**.

---

## 🚧 Future Improvements

* 🤖 Add **AI Opponent** using Minimax or Reinforcement Learning.
* 🌐 Implement **Online Multiplayer** mode.
* 🎨 Enhance **3D graphics** with textures and animations.
* 📱 Port to a **mobile-friendly version**.
